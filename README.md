# What is there in this Repository?
This project is a simple implementation of machine learning model creation made as a practice project. This project is also helpful for students who are new to the field of machine learning and want to learn with project based explainations. This projects aims to predict the either fraud or not fraud status of any transaction based on [creditcard.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) dataset available on Kaggle.

### This repository contains:
* **Introduction.md** - It provides a brief introduction and explains about the project and dataset.
* **Installation Requirements.md** - This file guides you for the downloading and installation processes of essential libraries, modules, text editor(Jupyter Notebook-in our case) and compatibilities for this project.
* **Credit Card Fraud Detection.ipynb** - This is the place where you are going to find all the code and their explainations required to implement this project.
* **Outputs** - It is the folder which contains all the output images generated during data processing and visualization tasks.

### Note:
* It is advised to go through the Introduction.md and Installation Requirements.md file before jumping to the notebook file.
* Due to large size of dataset (creditcard.csv) it has not been uploaded to the repository but the link to the dataset has already been provided above.
* Learners are requested to change the path of dataset, while reading data, as per their Computer directory location.
* All the learners are free to ask any question regarding this project work. I'll try to answer them each.
